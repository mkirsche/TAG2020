# Theory and Applications of Graphs, Fall 2020

## In-Class Presentations

Presentations should be 12-15 minutes in length, followed by about 3 minutes for questions.  Groups will consist of 3 members, and each group must present on a different topic or problem.

## Timeline

**10/06 and 10/07**: Details announced in class

**10/13 and 10/14**: Be ready to provide a list of group members, a name for your group, and a brief (one or two sentences) description of your topic area of choice.  I will ask for these in class during these dates, but if you would prefer to send this information over email, you are welcome to do so anytime before this class meeting.

**11/03 and 11/04**: 15-20 minutes at the the start of class will be spent meeting as groups to discuss the presentation, and I'll be checking in with each group to make sure everyone has a plan.

**11/17 and 11/18**: Class presentations!  Please send me your slides beforehand (no later than 11:59 EST the night before class) so I can refer to them before, during, and after the presentation.

## Suggested Presentation Outline

The presentation should give a topic area where graphs are used, and describe one particular problem in the field which is well-suited for graph algorithms.  It should present this problem and how it can be transformed into a graph problem, describe an algorithm which solves it, and go over some of the changes which can be made to make the algorithm work better in practice.

For example, in class we covered the topic area of navigation, and looked specifically at the problem of finding the shortest path along road networks.  We went over Breadth-First Search and its performance in theory, and then went on to talk about some of the heuristics used in practice such as A-Star and Contraction Hierarchies, giving real data which illustrates the impact of these changes.

Below is a recommended outline for the presentation.  It follows the "hourglass model", where the beginning and end are wider in scope, with the middle containing the more specific and technical details.  While the exact composition of slides is likely to vary between groups, each of the three sections below should receive approximately equal amounts of time.

### Background/motivation (4-5 minutes)
1. Brief description of your topic area
2. List of one or more data types that can be represented as graphs - what are the nodes and edges for each?
3. A problem that can be solved with graph algorithms (without going into how it uses the  and why we care about solving that problem

### Technical details and theory (4-5 minutes)
4. How to transform the problem above into a problem on graphs
5. An algorithm which attempts to solve that problem - you should list the inputs, the steps of the algorithm, and the outputs. An example might also be helpful here.
6. The theoretical (Big-O) worst-case runtime complexity of the algorithm you described

### Practical approaches (4-5 minutes)
7. What changes need to made to the algorithm to make it practical
8. Some practical runtime analysis - what sizes of datasets exist, and are people able to handle them in practice?
9. Some ideas for finding better solutions or for further speeding up the algorithm on certain kinds of datasets.

Please also include citations for any resources you used (a link to the webpages is fine).  If you have any questions about the presentations, or would like feedback on your idea, you are always welcome to email me or come to my office hours.
