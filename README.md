## Course Description

Theory and Applications of Graphs: Social Networks, Search Engines, and Gene Interactions	(EN 500.111)

Graphs are a mathematical structure used to represent relationships between objects, and they can be found throughout the sciences as well as in the computer and phone applications people use every day.  From modeling friendships in social networks, to giving the best directions on a map, to assembling genomes, there is a never-ending range of applications for graphs and the algorithms used to process them.  In this course we will explore some of the real-world applications of graphs which drive the need for efficient algorithms.

## Grading

This course is graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.  Grades will be based on two factors:
 * Regular attendance and participation in the course (at most one absence will be permitted except in the case of extraordinary circumstances)
 * A group presentation about a chosen application of graphs on the final day of class - details to follow
